Hi, I am Cavers Chen and this is my personal website!

I am a ZJUT student and my interest is computer graphics, because computer graphics is awesome!!!

Since this page is built for people to get to know me more quickly, you can check the following projects in that I have participated related to CG.

### Tooth Medical Software:

### Rendering Engine:
with the tutorial of Peter Shirley, I had a basic understanding of ray tracing algorithms. Also, I read some related books he recommended in this tutorial for further learning, such as Advanced Global Illumination. Later I wrote a fluid simulation solver, however, this part of the code was missed because of an error on my computer(I should regularly upload my code...)

* final work of part one (use 12 hours to get this result)

* Perlin noise + light source

### Shadertoy

I was fansinated with those amazing effect solely made by shader. In this aspect, Inigo Quilez is GOD(Don't know Inigo Quilez? check this [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/InigoQuilez).)

Inspired by some shaders which imitate the effect of cloud, I did some research and found this specific effect is created by fractal noise(Fractal Brownian Motion-FBM), you can use this to create the wave, cloud, end even landscape!

* shallow wave [check the source code and video](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fs3cRn)

### NetEase EStar-Plan

This is an open class offered by an Internet company, and I am honored to be able to participate. I learned how to write basic GLSL in this class, and found there is a big gap between industry and academia in computer graphics.

- code and report(Code is not available due to confidentiality requirements.)

### My First Game With C

The beginning of my dream. I wrote this in my first summer vacation when I was a first year undergraduate. I learned a simple graphics library called EasyX, which is simple as it said. This game first be realized on VS2017, later the game was ported to the BC platform. I remained the code, but unfortunately, the video of this game I played were missed.
* two pictures during playing

* Although I don't play football in real life, I was the honored player in this game. -- No.3 czy

I also wrote some small games while I tried to code this project, you can check it here!
